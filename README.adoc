The Zigbook was initially written by link:https://github.com/zigbook[@zigbook], an experienced Systems programmer and Zig community member to fill gaps in the existing resources, and share that knowledge with others. 

It has since grown into a a comprehensive guide to the Zig programming language, structured as a journey from fundamentals to advanced systems programming. It is designed for developers who want to *understand*, not just use; who value transparency over magic and precision over convenience.
